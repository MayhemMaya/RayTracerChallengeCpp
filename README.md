# RayTracerChallengeCpp

Building a Ray Tracer from scratch in C++ by following the book 'The Ray Tracer Challenge â€“ A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer' by Jamis Buck.

Link to the book: <https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/>

## Introduction

The book aims to guide you on how to build your own recursive ray tracing software in any OOP programming language of your choice using Test-Driven-Development (TDD).
All code in the book is written in pseudocode, it is up to the reader to decide how they will implement each component and run their tests.

## Aim

The aim after completing this book is to have a fully functional ray tracer written in C++ as a Console Application that can render images in the PPM image format at any given resolution.
