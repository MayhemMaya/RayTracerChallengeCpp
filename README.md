# RayTracerChallengeCpp

Building a Ray Tracer from scratch in C++ by following the book 'The Ray Tracer Challenge â€“ A Test-Driven Guide to Your First 3D Renderer' by Jamis Buck.

Link to the book: <https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge/>

## Introduction

The book aims to guide you on how to build your own recursive ray tracing software in any OOP programming language of your choice using test-first style and perform Unit tests along the way.
The book writes all code in pseudocode and it is up to the reader to decide how they will implement each component and how they will run their tests.

## Aim

The aim after completing this book is to have a fully functional ray tracer written in C++ as a Console Application that can render images in the PPM image format at any resolution.

Eventually this renderer wll be integrated into Autodesk Maya as a Maya Plug-in (.dll) so that users can export a Maya 3D scene to the renderer and send have that rendered image be back to Maya for Maya to display in a UI window.
